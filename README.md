# Gold prediction

 Recovered_gold_share_prediction_model
 Integrated project 2 from Practicum by Yandex

Goal
Develop a machine learning model for Zyfra, efficiency solutions for heavy industry company, 
that would analyze data on extraction and purification of gold from an ore and predict the amount of recovered gold.
The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.


This project includes the following steps:
Descriptive statistics;
Recovery calculation check;
Missing features analysis;
Data Preprocessing;
EDA: outliers and target variable analysis;
Features standard scaling;
Models' hyperparameters tuning;
Model selection
